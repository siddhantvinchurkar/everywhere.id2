>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
>i. Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.

# How to report a bug
### Explain security disclosures first!
At bare minimum, include this sentence:
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [siddhantvinchurkar@gmail.com](mailto:siddhantvinchurkar@gmail.com "Email Siddhant Vinchurkar") instead.

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to [siddhantvinchurkar@gmail.com](mailto:siddhantvinchurkar@gmail.com "Email Siddhant Vinchurkar")
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [siddhantvinchurkar@gmail.com](mailto:siddhantvinchurkar@gmail.com "Email Siddhant Vinchurkar").
